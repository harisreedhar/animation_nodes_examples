# abstract_wave_instance_noise

This nodetree is a motion design preset based on a cinema 4d tutorial :
    

It allows to duplicate a sprite on a grid and move it through a falloff (noise falloff here, but you can use others)

To use this, 
- set the sprite object and its visibility in Inputs category
- set the division and length on the grid on X and Y in the Inputs category
- set the scale of duplicated objects in the Inputs category
- set the speed of the animation (noise is driven by time) in the Inputs category
- set the offsets (initial and affected) of the instances in the Inputs category
- set the falloff (Falloff category

You can optionnially check with the Viewers the appearance of your grid, but careful, this will not be rendered.
